        McCall's was a monthly American women's magazine,
        published by the McCall Corporation, that enjoyed
        great popularity through much of the 20th century,
        peaking at a readership of 8.4 million in the early 1960s.
        It was established as a small-format magazine called
        The Queen in 1873. In 1897 it was renamed McCall's Magazine
        â€”The Queen of Fashion (later shortened to McCall's) and
        subsequently grew in size to become a large-format glossy.
        It was one of the "Seven Sisters" group of women's 
        service magazines.
