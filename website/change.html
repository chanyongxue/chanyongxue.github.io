        Ownership of McCall's began to change nearly <br>
        as fast as editors came and went. Norton Simon <br>
        sold McCall's to the Pritzker family in 1973. <br>
        Norton Simon kept the McCall pattern business, <br>
        which continues under different ownership. <br>
        In 1986, McCall's Publishing Company was bought <br>
        by Time Inc. and Lang Communications. In 1989, <br>
        McCall's was sold to The New York Times Company, <br>
        and in 1994, German-based Gruner + Jahr announced <br>
        plans to purchase their magazine business. <br>
        <br>
        In 2000, entertainer Rosie O'Donnell became editorial <br>
        director of McCall's. In 2001 McCall's was <br>
        renamed Rosie. O'Donnell stated, <br> <br>
        <span class="quote">"I wanted a magazine that celebrates real women,<br> 
            that understands that they care about more than <br>
            waistlines or the latest makeup styles or fashions, <br>
            that they want to be relevant and help each other <br>
            and care about the world."</span><br> <br>
        Rosie ceased publication at the end of 2002.<br> <br>
        O'Donnell said in a statement<br>
        <span class="quote">"I decided I could not participate in a magazine that <br>
        bears my name when I could not be assured it would <br>
        reflect my vision, values and editorial direction."</span><br>
